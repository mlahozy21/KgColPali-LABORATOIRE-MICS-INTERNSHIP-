# KgColPali-LABORATOIRE-MICS-INTERNSHIP-
Here, you have my internship report on RAG models in the medical field and the integration of Knowledge Graphs to their improve performance. Also, you have part of the code used (in my report I have used three different corpus, but here you have my model just with the corpus A (vidore/syntheticDocQA _healthcare_industry_test)).

The file mirage.py is the file which generates the responses of a subset of the medical benchmark MIRAGE (a subset because it is quite big).
And evaluate.py is the file which tells you the accuracy of the responses generates by mirage.py.
In addition, we have other files where i define the functions used in mirage.py (or in evaluate.py) or where i initialize the models used.
